    - favicon
    - id="root" - our entire app
- src
  In simplest form it's the brain of our app. This is where we will do all of our work. src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
- .gitignore
  Specifies which files source control (Git) should ignore

- package.json
  Every Node.js project has a package.json and it contains info about our project, for example list of dependencies and scripts

- package-lock.json
  A snapshot of the entire dependency tree

- README
  The markdown file where you can share more info about the project for example build instructions and summary
